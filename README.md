# **PyBlenderRender**
**A modular Python-based rendering pipeline for Blender, designed for automated camera positioning and rendering of 3D models.**

## **Features**

- Modular configuration for camera, lighting, and rendering
- Multiple camera path generation techniques (Spiral, Pole Rotation, Cube, etc.)
- Blender Python API for high-quality 3D rendering
- Extensible architecture for custom camera paths and lighting setups

---

## **Installation**

### **Prerequisites**

- Python 3.7 or later
- Blender Python API 4.0 or later

### **Install Dependencies**

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spa-dev/PyBlenderRender.git  
cd PyBlenderRender  
pip install .  
```

---

## **Usage**

### **1. Basic Example: Render with Default Settings**

```python
from src.renderer.model_renderer import ModelRenderer

renderer = ModelRenderer()  # Uses default configs
renderer.render()  # Runs rendering pipeline
```

### **2. Custom Camera Configuration**

```python
from src.renderer.config.camera_config import CameraConfig
from src.renderer.model_renderer import ModelRenderer

custom_camera = CameraConfig(
    distance=15.0, 
    camera_density=30, 
    path_type=CameraPathType.SPIRAL_PHI
)

renderer = ModelRenderer(camera_config=custom_camera)
renderer.render()
```

## **Examples**

### Orbit Camera Path  
The following GIF was created using `make_gif.py` from a sequence of PNG images generated by PyBlenderRender. The model is Rubik's Cube by BeyondDigital (see Attributions below) and script is located at:  
ðŸ“‚ `PyBlenderRender/scripts/make_gif.py`

### 3D Path Visualization  
This GIF is an animated visualization of a **3D camera path** created from `visualize_path.ipynb`. The notebook is located at:  
ðŸ“‚ `PyBlenderRender/notebooks/visualize_path.ipynb`

## **Known Issues**

### Camera Distance Variability in CameraPathType.CUBE

With the CUBE camera path type, the bottom view appears closer than others.  
This issue is possibly related to object tracking issues, where the Track  
To constraint might be influencing the final camera position in unexpected  
ways, especially at extreme elevations.

### Light Energy Calculation Inconsistencies

Light energy calculation does not account for all possible light types  
consistently. Try varying `light_intensity` in `LightingConfig` until you  
reach a suitable level.

---

## **Roadmap**

- Multiprocessing â€“ Improve performance by parallel processing of rendering

---

## **Extending the Project**

Want to add a custom camera path?

1. Create a new file in `src/renderer/camera/paths/`, e.g., `custom_path.py`.
2. Subclass `CameraPathGenerator` and implement `generate_positions()`.
3. Register it in `camera/registry.py`.
